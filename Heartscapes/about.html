            <h1>About Heartscapes</h1>
            <p>Heartscapes is a unique digital diary that explores the depths of human emotions through 3D modeling, design, code, and animation. 
            Inspired by the creator's own journey of self-discovery, Heartscapes provides a space for translating the complexities of emotional experiences into tangible, abstract forms.
            Heartscapes goes beyond the digital realm by organically evolving daily, reflecting the creator's own emotions and creating a unique connection between the physical self and the digital landscape.
